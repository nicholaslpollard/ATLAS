# ATLAS

**Autonomous Trading, Learning, and Analysis System**

**Current as of 2026-09-11 (UTC). The root README, `docs/roadmap.md`, and
`docs/strategy_evidence_register.md` are the three living project documents. Every
continuation chat must read all three in full before making recommendations or changes.**

ATLAS is the greenfield successor to Chart Monitor. Its purpose is to become a
usable quantitative trading platform that can discover and compare opportunities,
run faithful historical replays, construct risk-controlled trades, operate end to
end with PAPER money, record outcomes, show the operator what is happening, and
improve its strategy library without hindsight or silent self-modification.

Profit is an objective, never a guarantee. Activity, alerts, attractive charts, and
profitable backtests are not substitutes for positive expected value after costs,
controlled risk, prospective evidence, and reliable operation.

## Read this first

1. Read this entire README for the current handoff.
2. Read [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the complete mission, testing
   design, gates, and ordered work.
3. Read [`docs/strategy_evidence_register.md`](docs/strategy_evidence_register.md)
   for strategy/version evidence, condition specialties, dispositions, robustness
   state, and successor hypotheses.
4. Inspect code, tests, immutable phase evidence, and Git history only as needed to
   perform the active roadmap package. Those materials support the three living
   documents; they do not compete with them as current plans.
5. If the three living documents conflict, stop and reconcile them in the same
   package before proceeding.
6. Every repository-changing implementation package must update this README and
   `docs/roadmap.md` before acceptance. Any package that opens, changes, interprets,
   closes, calibrates, or promotes strategy evidence must update the Strategy
   Evidence Register in the same package. A future chat must be able to reconstruct
   current product state, research direction, and strategy evidence without a prior
   conversation window.

All earlier README/roadmap versions were archived verbatim under
`docs/archive/2026-09-02-pre-product-rebaseline/`. The old `current_status`,
`phase_flow`, and plain-English files are frozen compatibility snapshots, not
living handoffs. Historical incident, closeout, policy, evidence, and research
documents are immutable records and must not be rewritten to make a later result
look like an original pass.

## Direction established by ATLAS Review Chat 3

The prior roadmap let unsuccessful alpha research block product construction. That
dependency is retired.

ATLAS now advances on two parallel tracks:

- **Track A — Product:** finish the end-to-end operating system using clearly
  labeled reference/baseline strategies in historical replay and operational
  PAPER. Product completion does not imply alpha validation or LIVE eligibility.
- **Track B — Strategy & Research Lab:** catalog practitioner setups, implement
  faithful finite strategy specifications, backtest them without parameter fishing,
  learn where each works or fails, and later add higher-prior academic mechanisms
  and advanced alpha research.

The immediate research priority is practitioner strategies built from observable
price, volume, volatility, trend, momentum, gap, opening, and premarket signals.
They are useful reference mechanisms and product test loads. A Reddit post, book,
charting site, or popular indicator is an **idea source**, not proof of edge.
Academic and replication evidence receives a higher prior evidence weight, but all
strategies must earn ATLAS historical and prospective evidence.

ATLAS is a strategy-selection system, not a single-strategy bot. It will eventually
rank eligible opportunities using frozen, walk-forward estimates of probability,
net expectancy, downside, execution cost, confidence, correlation, concentration,
and current conditions. It must not search indicators live until something agrees
with a desired trade.

## Current repository truth

- **B35 canonical DEVELOPMENT replay is CLOSED / ACCEPTED.** The frozen `2016-01-04..2026-04-30` trial completed exactly **482/482 groups, 59,768/59,768 source units, and 482 validated receipt ids**, producing **20,171,286** compact fired opportunity/context/outcome records. Run fingerprint = `8955a282453cb89a24d3bcdf819d80451bebfa3ec9752dc24c113efc668cffe6`; B35/source/split/authorization identities remained exactly frozen. Consumed-master rows read `0`; future-blind rows read `0`; provider calls `0`; broker reads/writes `0/0`; PAPER/LIVE authority `false/false`; strategy/selector promotion `false/false`; no permanent minute feature lake was created. The accepted continuation reused 82 validated groups and computed the remaining 400 groups / 49,600 units in **11:40:46 at 4,246.7 units/hour**, about **6.43x** the original serial restart and **44.3% faster** than the final isolated exact-equivalent benchmark.
- **B35 strategy x condition / frozen walk-forward selector analysis is COMPLETE / PROFILE-ONLY.** PR #76 merged as `cceccdc23569f6d48395a52322a83f59ba555b23`. Analysis fingerprint `8369790cc019e84091d9ff431e0ba82678e8b23ec09f65f010cdfaca35d3254f` normalized all 20,171,286 accepted compact opportunities and built 33 complete-XNYS 504/63/63/1 folds. The frozen selector evaluated 17,030,985 test opportunities, selected 3,747 (3,188 comparable), and abstained on 99.978%. Selected mean return was +0.2984% / +0.1984% / +0.0485% / -0.2015% / -0.7014% at 0/10/25/50/100 bps. No strategy or selector is promoted. The material research interpretation and per-strategy dispositions are maintained in `docs/strategy_evidence_register.md`.
- **B35 retained-artifact robustness is COMPLETE / NO PROMOTION.** PR #78 merged as `83d09c424a02883f7d3529a39c62294dcbaf6bc2`; workstation robustness fingerprint = `c4489478e82a535ef890fd017e47c9594ad9d590d439c5f55089426bd8565107` across 2,079 complete XNYS test sessions. At 50 bps every declared standalone/selector profile has negative mean session return and Deflated-Sharpe probability `0.0`; 13 selected fold/cell hypotheses produced **0 BH-FDR q=.05 rejections**. The frozen selector remains positive at 0/10/25 bps but is negative at 50/100 bps; its 10,000-draw bootstrap assigns 24.21% probability to positive mean 50-bps session return. PBO/CSCV is 0.01%, retained only as a narrow ranking-stability diagnostic and not profitability evidence. No strategy/selector promotion occurred; consumed-master/future/provider/broker reads remain zero and PAPER/LIVE authority remains false.
- **B35 exact targeted minute perturbations are MERGED / WORKSTATION RUN PENDING.** PR #79 merged to `main` as `b6133d2efe8bc331a80d71bb2c0bfa47707655db`. One DEVELOPMENT-only pass freezes 27 one-axis-at-a-time strategy/variant profiles covering entry delay 0/1/2, gap threshold x0.9/1.0/1.1, ORB 14/15/16 minutes, premarket rel-vol threshold x0.9/1.0/1.1, and premarket consolidation-range x0.9/1.0/1.1 for premarket-relvol/HVD. Baseline variants are populated from the exact accepted canonical B35 outcome files with SHA-256 verification, and tests require exact outcome-economic parity in addition to count parity. Outputs are diagnostic, hash-receipted and restartable; canonical B35 v1 is immutable, selector refit is forbidden, and no promotion/PAPER/LIVE/master/future/provider/broker authority is granted. Immediate Track-B action is the workstation run `scripts/run_b35_targeted_perturbations.py --authorize-targeted-perturbations`; do not start the successor full-library replay until this bounded diagnostic closes.

- **B34 intraday source readiness and the opening/premarket pack are CLOSED / ACCEPTED.** The enhanced 2026-09-08 workstation audit returned `ACCEPTED` under contract `atlas-b34-intraday-source-readiness-v2-ohlcv-pack-frozen` with evidence SHA-256 `415c46c714b80f5cff4950320443088b8b89ed761c9f51d071fccf3e60baefd0`. It preserves the earlier semantic/source-readiness evidence SHA-256 `aad355e57c089a7aaea84a3f941091dec69d89ce87235972f13472a308550237`, accepted all five deterministic OHLCV samples, represented premarket/regular/after-hours bars, opened zero partitions overlapping the consumed `2026-05-12..2026-08-11` master interval, and made zero provider calls, broker reads, or broker writes. The frozen RESEARCH-only pack fingerprint is `6f7239fcda11ac6c890d2635980d431ec49e346707d9cc549f111bd50daaa4bf` for `b34_gap_continuation_v1`, `b34_opening_range_breakout_15m_v1`, `b34_premarket_relvol_consolidation_v1`, and `b34_highest_volume_day_style_v1`. B34 opened no outcomes and grants no promotion, PAPER, LIVE, broker-mutation, or broad/full minute-materialization authority.
- Accepted numbered foundation: **through Phase32**, merged on `main`.
- Phases26–32 are scientifically valid `ACCEPTED_NEGATIVE` results.
- Phases26–31 are scientifically valid `ACCEPTED_NEGATIVE`; Phase32 is
  `ACCEPTED_NEGATIVE` as well.
- Later XBRL, beneficial-ownership, FINRA short-interest, diluted-EPS, and Form 13F
  branches are also closed accepted-negative/source-limited results.
- Retained beneficial-ownership source-gate lineage: source-only feasibility
  mechanism `PIT_SEC_SCHEDULE_13D_13G_BENEFICIAL_OWNERSHIP_DISCLOSURE`; frozen
  feasibility fingerprint
  `f1b6a5b22be1e5bbb3c5317118d0af88baaac40836a6b7051e6bc4789b3bb3bb`.
  These are historical source-feasibility identifiers, distinct from the later
  frozen scientific mechanism and preserved for accepted-validator compatibility.
- Historical supported modern alpha remains **0**. No existing strategy is
  historically validated, paper validated, live eligible, or live authorized.
- The retained master protected outcome window `2026-05-12..2026-08-11` was
  **consumed exactly once on 2026-09-07** by the frozen A33/B33 V2 walk-forward.
  The completed receipt/accounting reports **93,380 master-protected return rows
  read**. The frozen version then continued unchanged through the accepted V2
  source cutoff `2026-09-03`; rows after `2026-08-11` are separately tracked as
  post-protected continuation, not a redefinition of the master holdout. This is
  historical out-of-sample evidence, not prospective PAPER.
- V2 split-reconciliation validator repair: provider-native split-adjusted volume
  is no longer required to equal the inverse OHLC split factor. That relationship
  is retained as deterministic audit evidence, while OHLC factor agreement,
  provider/source provenance, schema, finite/nonnegative volume, and other
  raw/adjusted integrity gates remain fail-closed. Focused regressions cover both
  accepted volume divergence and rejected price-factor corruption. At repair
  acceptance this changed no source bytes, strategy/portfolio policy, trading
  authority, or protected-return state; the later frozen replay described below
  subsequently consumed the master holdout exactly once.
- V2 split-price quantization repair: the real completed V2 source showed that the
  former absolute `1e-5` OHLC-factor equality was also too strict for provider-rounded
  split-adjusted prices. The retained quantization diagnostic covered 2,825,114 paired
  eligible rows: maximum adjusted-price residual was `$0.05841364` and maximum
  relative factor error was `0.000994532`. Reconciliation now fails closed unless each
  open/high/low value is within `$0.10` adjusted-price residual **and** `0.001` relative
  factor error of the close-derived split factor. A new regression accepts bounded
  provider rounding while the existing corruption regression still rejects a material
  price-factor mismatch. At repair acceptance it changed no source bytes,
  strategy/portfolio policy, holdout receipt, protected-return state, PAPER
  authority, or LIVE authority; the later frozen replay subsequently consumed the
  master holdout exactly once.
- LIVE trading and automatic broker failover remain disabled.
- The former operator pause is satisfied and superseded by the explicit Review
  direction encoded here. Product and practitioner-library work may resume; it
  grants no trading authority by itself.
- The unmerged Review research lineage remains preserved: LIT-01 Heston-Sadka
  calendar-seasonality work is source-inconclusive; LIT-02 terminal-repair work is
  deferred/incomplete. Neither grants alpha support or changes `main` authority.
- The former statement `Phase33 signal-to-trade remains blocked` is retained only
  as historical roadmap provenance. Product signal-to-trade work is now unblocked
  for historical replay and operational PAPER baselines. LIVE remains blocked.
- Product/strategy rebaseline: PR #44 merged to `main` as
  `6b972c4d26dfa350580e269d8010038fe526cf4f`, based on the accepted PR #43 Form
  13F closeout.
- A33/B33 phase-start contracts: PR #45 merged as
  `bc105be4958cce808dbbeb306f0ec58f23b13a6d`. Its six pre-outcome seed
  specifications, broader research taxonomy, authority transition rules, and
  shared opportunity-event contract remain preserved.
- A33/B33 foundation implementation is complete and protected by its exact-head
  acceptance workflow. Historical performance has now been opened only for the
  frozen V2 DEVELOPMENT and one-time walk-forward versions described below; strategy
  authority did not change and provider/broker/PAPER/LIVE mutations remain zero.
- A33/B33 compatibility validation now treats living-document protected state as a
  monotonic lifecycle: before outcome access it requires the original zero-read
  boundary; after an accepted one-time consumption it requires the current
  consumption statement and protected-row accounting instead. Frozen policy,
  authority, and feature fingerprints remain mandatory. This prevents current
  evidence from being rewritten backward merely to satisfy a historical handoff
  token.
- The trusted-lake adapters are implemented. The retained Massive path remains
  reproducibility-only; the isolated Alpaca SIP V2 adapter produced the completed
  frozen DEVELOPMENT and walk-forward evidence described below.
- The adapter package was accepted in PR #47 and merged as
  `646db6e6e44ccd2355c7c2263221f35cd01d5da8`; its post-merge Windows and Ubuntu
  full-suite jobs passed.
- The first A34 RESEARCH account-replay vertical slice is implemented: deterministic
  candidate admission, cash/position accounting, simulated orders, outcomes, equity
  curve, read-only API, and visible browser state. Empirical V2 DEVELOPMENT and
  frozen walk-forward account replays now exist and are negative at the aggregate
  account level; no strategy was promoted. The slice was accepted in PR #48 and
  merged as
  `147b95810936a0b10b24eb08e51cd4d83c16c85b`; its post-merge Windows and Ubuntu
  full-suite jobs passed.
- The accepted Phase19 operator-path correction is merged in PR #49 as
  `cc0ecc6995ad977ca6eeb5fc00983ba2926317a0`; its post-merge Windows and Ubuntu
  full-suite jobs passed. The current stacked dashboard, not the legacy Phase16
  shell, is the authoritative local GUI entry point.
- The hash-verified A34 operator drilldown was accepted in PR #50 and merged as
  `f0a45cbff2662e26f4f1f55e8a16c0c356c9266c`; its post-merge Windows and Ubuntu
  full-suite jobs passed. The dashboard now verifies and displays account metrics,
  decisions, rejection reasons, simulated orders, outcomes, and equity/exposure.
- Exact point-in-time market-regime context was accepted in PR #51 and merged as
  `e2dd741b4cdd3f5b729c4ec1cb510451887c748c`; its post-merge `main` test workflow
  passed. Daily close-derived signals now carry the exact XNYS-close availability
  clock and the replay consumes only the hash-bound same-close market regime that
  was knowable before next-open entry. Ticker/sector regime remain unavailable.
- Alpaca SIP V2 daily source/replay preparation and the finite B34 minute/intraday semantics audit are complete and accepted. Empirical sizing
  estimates 3.781B native minute rows, 64.51 GiB canonical minute Parquet, 62.55
  GiB compressed raw evidence, and a conservative 375.58 GiB peak-plus-reserve
  requirement. The operator chose precise local V1 historical-data decommissioning,
  not a local V1 archive. The first rebuild-safety package provides a generation-
  isolated `data/v2_build/alpaca_sip_v2` layout, atomic run state, a 30 GiB reserve
  guard, and an allowlisted content-hash-bound V1 decommission plan. It deliberately
  preserves live, model, unrelated research, repository, and accepted evidence
  state. The explicit `--decommission-v1-only` run completed successfully on the
  operator workstation on 2026-09-03 local time: **8 targets / 38,034 files /
  147,206,406,678 bytes (137.10 GiB)** were deleted after the exact generated token
  was confirmed. The retained receipt is
  `data/checkpoints/alpaca_v2_migration/v1_decommission_receipt.json`. ATLAS now has
  no accepted historical market database. The read-only post-decommission inventory
  then identified database-generation remnants that were outside the first eight
  targets: `raw/day_aggs_v1`, legacy `provider/alpaca`, old ML training data,
  discovery/universe/regime/quality/reference products, and their ingestion/manifests.
  Accepted strategy-evaluation evidence, SEC/regulatory source evidence, live state,
  models, source code, and Git history remain outside the expanded cleanup boundary.
- The fresh-source native V2 package was accepted in PR #57 and its first operator
  acquisition completed on 2026-09-07. `scripts/run_alpaca_v2_rebuild.py --build-v2`
  first
  inventories and asks for
  exact hash-bound confirmation of only the remaining database-derived targets; it
  writes a new plan-hash-specific receipt and never overwrites the original receipt.
  It then freezes the last completed XNYS session, captures fresh active and inactive
  Alpaca assets plus complete-quality corporate actions, builds an exact-literal
  acquisition universe, and runs native `1Day` units before native `1Min` units.
  The source contract is Alpaca SIP, raw adjustments, `asof=-`, 10,000 total bars per
  page, opaque pagination until the token is null, and New York local-midnight
  windows with the inclusive API end moved back one microsecond. Every page is an
  atomic restart boundary; exact response bytes, checksums, request metadata,
  normalized page shards, unit Parquet, quarantine records, and run/plan manifests
  live only beneath `data/v2_build/alpaca_sip_v2`. Provider-rejected or anomalous
  literals are quarantined without substitution. The runner reserves 30 GiB and
  pauses safely when capacity is insufficient. The estimated 3.781B minute rows mean
  one overnight run was not assumed; rerunning the identical command resumed rather
  than restarted. The final operator report is `COMPLETE`: **67,480 / 67,480 units**,
  including **5,302 / 5,302 daily** and **62,178 / 62,178 minute** units,
  **3,897,688,734 canonical rows**, and **1,757,288 quarantined rows**. This is a
  complete isolated native candidate base, not production promotion. The quarantine
  is retained evidence and was carried into the post-build gate rather than
  discarded or assumed harmless. Historical V2 RESEARCH results now exist only for
  the frozen versions described below; PAPER authority and LIVE authority remain
  absent.
- The V2 post-build package was accepted in PR #58 and merged as
  `8e5abf21fe1ca138cd90125005b8c305a598dd44`; its post-merge `main` workflow passed
  on Windows and Ubuntu. It has now run successfully against the completed operator
  V2 source: native validation passed **67,480 / 67,480 units**, the provider-native
  split source reused **5,302 / 5,302 complete units**, and the reconciled research
  view materialized **2,706,154 rows across 1,582 symbols**. Its single resume-safe
  post-build
  coordinator hash-verifies every native unit; fully scans native daily schema,
  provenance, dates, sessions, duplicates, and OHLCV; builds conservative direct-
  Alpaca-asset identity/lifecycle evidence; acquires a separate provider-native SIP
  `adjustment=split` daily source; reconciles raw and adjusted bars; and materializes
  a hash-bound V2 daily research view. Name changes, mergers, reorganizations,
  spin-offs/rights, stock distributions, termination/redemption events, ticker reuse,
  uncertain security type, source anomalies, and internally gapped streams are
  excluded rather than silently stitched until a separate segment and cash-flow
  policy exists. Native raw prices remain separate. The research view carries
  unadjusted same-session close for the PIT `$5` universe floor so a future split
  cannot rewrite historical eligibility. Although source capture continues through
  its frozen current cutoff, the strategy-input Parquet ends physically at the
  **2026-05-11 DEVELOPMENT boundary** and materializes zero protected-window return
  rows. It does not promote a production database or grant historical, PAPER, or
  LIVE authority. Compile-all and the complete local
  suite pass at **1,546 tests**; all ten PR #58 exact-head workflow groups and the
  post-merge `main` workflow passed.
- The frozen walk-forward package is implemented and tested in PR #61 after native
  completion and before any operator V2 performance read. The default DEVELOPMENT
  manifest and adapter still end
  physically at `2026-05-11` and reject every later row. A separate
  `walk_forward_daily.json` generation can be created only after an immutable,
  self-hash-bound authorization records the exact native/split source plus frozen
  strategy, feature, and portfolio fingerprints. Its signal interval begins exactly
  `2026-05-12`; earlier rows are indicator warm-up only, and its end must equal the
  latest validated V2 source session. The trials ledger, strategy replay, account
  replay, post-build manifest, and permanent consumption receipt all account for the
  protected rows. A failed attempt after opening remains consumed. No parameter
  revision, historical-to-PAPER relabeling, strategy promotion, or external write is
  permitted by this path. The restart repair preserves each superseded consumption
  receipt as a content-addressed snapshot, verifies the complete history before
  continuation, retains known protected-row counts across attempts, and reuses a
  completed replay only after its operator artifact verification passes. Missing or
  inconsistent current/history receipts fail closed; source-only reruns cannot erase
  prior consumption. The GUI shows the attempt and known/pending row accounting and
  never describes an incomplete run as unopened. The materialization-cutoff failure
  path also preserves an observed protected-row count in both the receipt and
  post-build summary. Three additional pytest cases cover that failure and successful
  retries after cutoff and replay failures. The complete implementation revision
  `0879bbed7f22c53108f58db0b790f58c61a04987` passed all **ten PR #61 workflow
  groups**, including the locked Windows and Ubuntu full suites at **1,581 tests
  plus 4 subtests per platform** and all three retained A33/A34 validators. Local
  checks also passed 10 isolated standard-library receipt tests, 13 isolated
  coordinator checks, Python compilation, JavaScript syntax, dependency-lock
  validation, and secret hygiene. Local isolation was necessary because application
  dependencies were absent; the full application evidence comes from locked CI.
  The implementation closeout changed only the two living documents after the code
  package. The authorized workstation run has now completed. DEVELOPMENT produced
  **161,347 opportunities**, account replay **-17.912608%** return and
  **-20.803073%** max drawdown. The frozen walk-forward evaluated signals
  `2026-05-12..2026-09-03`, produced **14,081 opportunities**, consumed the retained
  master holdout exactly once with **93,380 protected return rows read**, and ended
  with account replay **-8.372772%** return and **-8.372772%** max drawdown. Signal-
  level mean net return was positive for Bollinger-long, EMA-pullback-long,
  MACD-long, and RSI-recovery-long, but the aggregate account evidence is negative,
  the RSI sample is small, cash-distribution economics remain incomplete, and
  **authority promotion is none**. All nine policies remain RESEARCH; PAPER/LIVE
  authority remains absent.
- **A34.5 operator live observability is now implemented in PR #60.** Its
  accepted merge closes the observability prerequisite before A35; A35 itself remains
  a separate PAPER/broker-authority package and has not begun. No PAPER broker
  mutation is authorized by A34.5.
- The former Phase39 LIVE numbering is retained: **Phase39** remains Controlled
  LIVE Activation and is still protected by all preceding evidence and authority
  gates.

## What exists now

The accepted foundation already includes provider ingestion, PIT identity/history,
Parquet/DuckDB analytical storage, deterministic features, universe/discovery,
market/sector/ticker regime context, ML evidence, strategy routing, instrument and
trade geometry, portfolio risk planning, AI review boundaries, broker-neutral
SHADOW/PAPER primitives, Webull-primary and manual-Alpaca-secondary controls,
restart-safe orchestration, API/browser primitives, and historical production-path
reconstruction.

Important limitations:

- The accepted Phase11 strategy registry still contains eight simplified daily
  rule variants. A33/B33 adds a separate, versioned reference-strategy catalog so
  accepted behavior is not silently changed.
- The accepted PR #45 six-specification seed catalog remains an immutable
  pre-outcome compatibility layer. The nine direction-specific policies resolve
  its declared implementation blockers without rewriting that accepted lineage.
- The first six practitioner families now have nine direction-specific, complete
  research policies covering universe, signal, side, timing, stop, target, exit,
  sizing, costs, and authority.
- A separate daily reference-feature overlay now supplies the exact indicator
  transitions needed by those policies without changing the accepted 33-feature
  core. Intraday, premarket, and opening-session features remain deferred.
- The existing router applies fixed regime compatibility; it does not yet learn
  conditional, walk-forward strategy performance or calibrated probability.
- A provider-free independent-strategy runner, condition-sliced opportunity/outcome
  records, append-only strategy-trials ledger, and read-only catalog API now exist.
  A read-only trusted-lake adapter now supplies its exact input contract. The first
  fixed, non-learned account replay and browser view now exist; learned selection,
  qualifying PAPER, strategy-management controls, and the complete operator product
  remain unfinished.
- A34.5 now supplies the accepted read-only near-live Operational PAPER dashboard
  contract over engine-owned evidence: no second GUI trading truth, no independent
  trade decisions, bounded automatic refresh, and visible fail-closed degraded/
  invalid state. A35 broker mutation remains a separate authority package.
- PostgreSQL and the root Docker deployment remain historical scaffolds, not an
  accepted operational database or deployment.

The decommissioned V1 daily lake used Alpaca SIP through `2021-08-13` and
Massive from `2021-08-16`. That boundary is retained historical provenance, not the
current data path. The fresh V2 candidate base is Alpaca SIP throughout its frozen
acquisition interval. No V1 row, derived indicator, regime, or identity product may
be silently reused as V2 input. Earlier source limitations do not authorize invented intraday history; V2 minute semantics are now accepted by B34, and missing minute history remains preserved as absence rather than synthesized.

## A33/B33 reference foundation

The **A33/B33 — Practitioner Strategy Laboratory and Product Rebaseline**
foundation implements:

1. a stable, versioned reference catalog alongside the accepted registry;
2. separate indicators, setup signals, complete trade policies, routing, and
   authority;
3. the missing daily features required by the first six reference families;
4. the first finite daily reference library;
5. a reusable, PIT-safe historical runner and opportunity/outcome
   ledger that records fired, rejected, routed, and counterfactual strategies;
6. report structures by time, market/sector/ticker regime, volatility, liquidity,
   and direction without mining sparse condition combinations;
7. a read-only product/control-plane catalog view and append-only trials ledger;
8. proof that these research baselines cannot become PAPER or LIVE
   authority accidentally; and
9. a read-only adapter from accepted Massive canonical daily partitions and
   retained identity/split evidence into the frozen runner input contract.

The first six families contain nine direction-specific policy versions:

1. 50/200 moving-average trend cross;
2. 20/50 EMA pullback continuation;
3. MACD momentum shift;
4. RSI trend-filtered mean reversion;
5. 20-session Donchian high-volume breakout;
6. Bollinger compression breakout.

Gap/opening-range and premarket relative-volume consolidation breakouts follow only
after trusted minute/premarket coverage and exact session semantics pass a
source-only readiness gate. The Reddit “Highest Volume Day” setup belongs in that
later intraday pack as a quantitatively defined, unverified practitioner hypothesis;
its reported statistics are not ATLAS evidence.

No historical performance is opened until each implemented strategy version has a
frozen universe, signal, direction, timing, exit, risk, cost, and evaluation
contract. One canonical version per genuinely different family comes before
variants.

Frozen A33/B33 contracts:

- reference strategy-policy fingerprint:
  `26a6aae124b1a5d2b14b8a11a72671b06ac34d3cf94eb7ac47f16d2cfb94a8b3`;
- strategy-authority fingerprint:
  `a23ec27367ae540b869abc428d118241e84436719a8a543cbdbc3f3b678c69c5`;
- daily reference-feature fingerprint:
  `ee7e09b680b64b65280dea88c01d402bd9576a04cc70bc7748d8e3048ff57159`.
  This pre-outcome correction binds the PIT `$5` price floor to the unadjusted
  same-session close while indicators and returns remain split-adjusted.
- retained legacy trusted-lake adapter contract:
  `reference-lake-adapter-v1-massive-development-split-free-identity-exact`.
- isolated V2 adapter contract:
  `reference-v2-lake-adapter-v2-alpaca-sip-hash-bound-explicit-evaluation-scopes`.

All nine policies remain `RESEARCH` authority and are permitted only in
`RESEARCH_REPLAY`. The runner accepts caller-supplied split-adjusted daily bars,
rejects every post-DEVELOPMENT row by default, creates signals only at finalized
closes, and enters no earlier than the next session open. Its distinct one-time
walk-forward mode requires explicit master-holdout authorization, uses earlier rows
only for indicator warm-up, filters signal generation to `2026-05-12` onward, and
counts the protected rows it reads.
It retains fired, rejected, selected-independent, and overlap-suppressed
counterfactual opportunities across the `0/5/10/25/50` bps grid. Empirical V2
DEVELOPMENT and frozen walk-forward account replays now exist. The retained master
holdout was consumed exactly once; **93,380** master-protected return rows were
read. The frozen walk-forward continued unchanged through `2026-09-03`; no
parameter revision or strategy promotion occurred. Broker writes: **0**; PAPER
submits: **0**; LIVE writes: **0**.

The retained adapter is deliberately narrower than the accepted complete daily history. V1
uses Massive only from `2021-08-16` through at most `2026-05-11`, requires every
requested XNYS partition, resolves exact identity without current active/delisted
filters, rejects internal stream gaps, and excludes an entire identity if any of its
observed tickers has a documented split in scope. Because retained canonical prices
are unadjusted, only these factor-1-equivalent streams may be labeled
`SPLIT_ADJUSTED`; no factor is guessed. This costs coverage but prevents false
signals and returns. Alpaca pre-seam and split-affected streams remain deferred to a
separately validated adjustment-capable V2. The new V2 adapter accepts only
`data/v2_build/alpaca_sip_v2/manifests/research_daily.json` and its exact partition
hashes; arbitrary paths and legacy fallback are forbidden. It validates Alpaca SIP,
split-adjusted, regular-session, identity-clear common-stock provenance and the
regular-open/source versus regular-close/signal clocks before returning a row.
A separate `ReferenceV2WalkForwardLakeAdapter` accepts only
`walk_forward_daily.json`, verifies its immutable authorization self-hash and frozen
strategy/feature/portfolio fingerprints, requires a permanent consumption receipt,
requires the exact authorized warm-up start plus the complete protected interval,
and requires the requested end to equal the source cutoff. It is never an automatic
fallback.

The replay input now has two separate clocks. The canonical daily
`timestamp_utc` remains the provider's regular-open stamp for source provenance;
`signal_available_at_utc` is derived from the XNYS regular close under contract
`reference-signal-availability-v1-xnys-regular-close-next-open`. Close-derived
signals are recorded at that availability time and still cannot enter before the
next regular-session open. This corrects evidence labeling without changing the
previous next-open return simulation or claiming that any empirical result exists.

The retained read-only regime adapter contract
`reference-regime-context-v1-exact-asof-hash-bound-same-close-market-only` attaches
the accepted same-session finalized market regime to a next-open decision. It
requires the split-origin manifest whose `as_of_date` exactly equals the replay end,
verifies the bound snapshot and `market_effective.parquet` SHA-256 values, rejects
future, duplicate, blank, or missing-session state, and writes no production state.
No accepted PIT instrument-to-sector mapping or reference ticker-state join exists,
so ticker and sector regime fields remain `UNAVAILABLE` rather than inferred.
No accepted V2 PIT regime generation exists yet. V2 replay therefore labels market,
sector, and ticker regime `UNAVAILABLE` and reads zero retained V1 regime rows rather
than importing the decommissioned generation or guessing a label.

The native V2 acquisition, post-build, DEVELOPMENT replay, and frozen one-time
walk-forward have all completed on the operator workstation. The browser read model
prefers the hash-valid completed walk-forward and fails closed rather than silently
falling back to legacy or DEVELOPMENT evidence when protected-state artifacts are
invalid. DEVELOPMENT account replay returned **-17.912608%** with
**-20.803073%** max drawdown. The frozen walk-forward through `2026-09-03` returned
**-8.372772%** with **-8.372772%** max drawdown and read **93,380** rows from the
retained master protected interval. Performance is now opened for these frozen
versions; no strategy was promoted.

The local command first runs the adapter, binds its source fingerprint,
and registers the frozen trial before calculating any strategy outcome. It can stop
after source validation or continue through the independent-strategy replay:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_a33_b33_reference_development.py --data-source v2 --source-only
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_a33_b33_reference_development.py --data-source v2
```

The full command writes its lake-adapter and regime-context reports, independent
opportunity ledger, account admission decisions, simulated orders, position
outcomes, equity curve, summaries, and append-only trial records beneath the V2
generation; it does not write to a provider, broker, PAPER account, or LIVE account
and cannot promote authority. `--source-only` validates V2 input and explicit
unavailable regime context and stops before any performance outcome is opened.
`--data-source legacy` preserves the former Massive-only evidence path for
reproducibility; it is never an automatic fallback.

The first V2 analytical stream is provider-native **split-adjusted price return**.
It does not yet credit or debit cash distributions in position P&L. Any optional
first replay is therefore a product/research diagnostic, not qualifying historical
evidence; dividend and spin-off cash-flow economics must be added or conservatively
bounded before a strategy can earn historical authority.

## A34 RESEARCH account replay

The first A34 product vertical slice has frozen portfolio-policy fingerprint
`c6528b5619a0058131347715dae771474a7b37babda282856f5f53a430f792fa`.
It processes each session in this order: opening exits, opening candidate admission,
intraday daily-bar exits, then closing valuation. The fixed baseline begins with
`$100,000`, risks at most `0.25%` of current equity per admitted position, caps one
position at `10%` of equity, gross exposure at `100%`, open positions at `10`, and
active positions from one strategy family at `3`. Same-session candidates are
balanced by current family load and then stable identifiers; realized returns are
never used to rank them.

This is a **RESEARCH account replay**, not qualifying historical validation. V1 is
long-only: short signals and their independent counterfactual results are retained,
but account admission rejects them until short borrow, locate fees, recalls, and
asymmetric execution are modeled. Correlation and sector controls also remain
explicitly unavailable rather than guessed. A conservative `10` bps round-trip cost
is charged as `5` bps on entry and `5` bps on exit. Candidates without a resolved
historical exit are rejected so the V1 account finishes cash-reconciled and flat.

The local control plane exposes the latest result read-only at
`/api/v1/research/reference-replay`. The browser shows all nine frozen policies,
RESEARCH authority, per-strategy account statistics, replay
return/drawdown/costs, recent completed positions, admission decisions, simulated
order events, and a closing-equity/exposure curve. Before displaying an available
run, the read model verifies the recorded SHA-256 binding and schema of every
decision, order, outcome, and equity artifact; drift fails closed as `INVALID`. It
shows `NOT_RUN` honestly until the trusted-lake command produces artifacts. After
the one-time walk-forward completes, it prefers that separately labeled result,
verifies the completed consumption receipt and protected-row count, and labels the
GUI `WALK-FORWARD`; an incomplete/failed consumption never falls back to a seemingly
clean DEVELOPMENT display. Policy
promotion: **false**; master-protected return rows read: **93,380**; holdout
consumed: **true exactly once**; provider writes: **0**; broker writes: **0**; PAPER
submits: **0**; LIVE writes: **0**.

The current operator entry point is the stacked Phase19 dashboard, not the older
Phase16 shell. Start it from the repository root with
`python scripts/run_phase19_control_plane.py` (or
`.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_phase19_control_plane.py` on Windows), then
open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Its A33/A34 Strategy Laboratory panel reads the
catalog and latest replay through the two local GET endpoints; loading or refreshing
the panel does not call a market-data provider or broker.

Market-regime condition slices now use the hash-bound same-session finalized market
regime that was knowable at the signal close and before the next-open entry. Ticker
and sector condition slices remain explicitly `UNAVAILABLE`; they must not be used
for conditional performance claims until their separate PIT joins are accepted.

## A34.5 operator live observability gate

PR #60 (`a34-5-frontend-operator-dashboard`) completes the A34.5 read-only
operator-observability gate when this closeout is accepted and merged.
`PaperDashboardService` reads accepted local Phase15 execution evidence plus
Phase5 persisted marks, verifies artifact path/hash/schema before display, and
never initializes a provider or broker merely to refresh the browser. Fresh LONG
positions mark conservatively at bid and SHORT positions at ask; stale marks cannot
create P&L, provider uncertainty is visibly `DEGRADED`, and invalid evidence is
`INVALID`. Strategy provenance and realized net P&L remain explicitly unavailable
where the accepted upstream evidence does not bind them.

The production surface is GET-only at `/api/v1/ops/paper-dashboard` on the existing
loopback-only Phase19 server. The operator console uses bounded 5/15/30-second
polling and organizes Overview, Market, Research, Portfolio, Execution, Brokers &
Data, Operations, and Controls without maintaining a second trading truth. A
separate synthetic Codespaces preview never loads `.env`, never initializes real
providers/brokers, disables mutation controls, and rejects POST. A34.5 grants no
PAPER strategy authority or broker-write authority; it only satisfies the
observability prerequisite so A35 can begin under its own explicit authority gate.

This is a product-readiness gate, not a strategy-evidence promotion.
The accepted dashboard must make it easy to see, as the PAPER system operates:

- account equity, cash/buying power, exposure, realized P&L, unrealized P&L, and
  relevant daily/session totals;
- every open position with ticker, strategy/version, side, quantity, entry/current
  price, stop/target/invalidation state, risk, and unrealized dollar/percent P&L;
- the decision stream: what setup fired, relevant market/condition context, concise
  deterministic selection/rejection reasoning, sizing/risk reasoning, authority,
  and AI audit/review state when applicable;
- planned/submitted/accepted/partially-filled/filled/canceled/rejected order events
  and reconciliation state;
- exits/sales with exit reason, price, realized dollar/percent P&L, costs, and hold
  duration;
- searchable/reviewable closed-trade and decision history plus strategy-level and
  account-level statistics; and
- market-data/provider/broker freshness and health, last successful update,
  orchestration state, authority mode, and kill/emergency-control visibility.

The UI must update through an accepted event-driven or short-polling mechanism
without requiring the operator to manually refresh the page. It must read the same
engine-owned decision/order/position/account records used for execution and
reconciliation; it may format or aggregate them but must not maintain a separate
trading truth or recompute trading decisions independently. Unknown or stale state
must be obvious and fail closed. A34.5 completion grants no PAPER authority by
itself; it removes the observability prerequisite so A35 can begin under its own
centralized PAPER authority gate.

## Strategy authority and PAPER/LIVE boundary

Every strategy carries two separate labels:

- **Evidence source:** `PRACTITIONER_BASELINE`, `LITERATURE_ANCHORED`, or
  `INTERNAL_CHALLENGER`.
- **Authority:** `RESEARCH` → `CANDIDATE` → `HISTORICALLY_VALIDATED` →
  `PAPER_VALIDATED` → `LIVE_ELIGIBLE`.

Authority controls what a strategy may do. Ranking controls which eligible
opportunity ATLAS prefers. A high score cannot bypass an authority gate.

Two PAPER modes are required:

- **Operational PAPER** exercises the product with baselines. Results are useful
  for debugging and learning, but cannot qualify a strategy for LIVE. Operational
  PAPER is additionally blocked until the A34.5 operator live-observability gate is
  accepted.
- **Qualifying PAPER** begins only after a version is historically validated and
  the prospective policy is frozen. It is the strongest empirical gate to LIVE,
  but still must pass profitability, sample, risk, drawdown, stability, execution,
  concentration, and operational checks.

`PAPER P&L > 0` alone is never enough. LIVE also requires `LIVE_ELIGIBLE` status,
system-level readiness, explicit operator authorization, small initial exposure,
hard loss limits, reconciliation, a kill control, and no automatic broker failover.

## Non-negotiable safeguards

- Preserve point-in-time identity, provider-native symbols, chronology, corporate
  actions, delistings, and session semantics; fail closed on ambiguity.
- Do not silently weaken transaction-cost, slippage, spread, borrow, capacity,
  liquidity, or market-impact assumptions.
- Use the retained `0/5/10/25/50` bps diagnostic grid where comparable, with
  10 bps primary and 25 bps stress for signal-level daily screening; executable
  replay must replace generic costs with instrument-, side-, liquidity-, volatility-,
  and order-aware costs.
- Signals computed at a bar close enter no earlier than the next executable event.
  Same-bar high/low cannot fill an order created from that bar's close.
- Treat overlapping trades, shared sessions, tickers, sectors, and market moves as
  dependent observations.
- Keep a trials ledger and apply family-level multiple-testing controls. A hundred
  indicator parameterizations are not a hundred independent discoveries.
- Use chronological walk-forward selection, purging/embargo where labels overlap,
  frozen challengers, and untouched qualifying periods.
- Use the master protected window only once for the already-frozen practitioner
  walk-forward evaluation. Never use its results to select parameters and then call
  the same interval validation; any revision becomes a new version whose evidence
  starts after the revision.
- No production self-modification. A learned selector or strategy revision is a new
  version that must be frozen, replayed, PAPER qualified, and explicitly promoted.
- Zero trades or negative results are valid. Stop a branch when expected information
  gain no longer justifies its infrastructure or source-repair cost.
- Prefer trusted existing market data. Novel difficult sources must beat simpler
  available experiments on expected research value before receiving priority.

## Data repair and V2 policy

When historical data becomes materially questionable:

1. investigate root cause and reconcile local files, transformations, provider
   semantics, and authoritative sources;
2. repair V1 only when the economic meaning remains trustworthy;
3. otherwise preserve V1 results/provenance and either freeze the persisted V1 lake
   or, when explicitly authorized as here, decommission only its exact historical
   namespaces through a reviewed hash-bound plan;
4. build a separately versioned V2 with authoritative sources and explicit
   canonical rules;
5. never substitute V2 underneath an observed experiment or describe it as the
   same experiment; and
6. preserve provenance and old results for audit.

Repeated authoritative-source contradictions do not justify purge/refetch loops
whose only purpose is to make evidence disappear.

The current Alpaca V2 rebuild is started or resumed from PowerShell with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_alpaca_v2_rebuild.py --build-v2
```

The first invocation may display a small residual cleanup plan and require its exact
generated token. Later invocations reuse the frozen cutoff/source/plan and verify
completed artifacts before continuing. Do not delete the V2 checkpoint tree or vary
`--start-date` between resumes. `Ctrl+C`, a time limit, a network failure, or the disk
floor leaves a resumable checkpoint; none grants production-data or trading authority.

After that command returns `NATIVE V2 ACQUISITION COMPLETE`, do not delete or move
its generation. Pull the accepted post-build package and run one of these:

```powershell
# Source validation, identity/lifecycle, split-adjusted daily acquisition, and V2 research view.
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_alpaca_v2_postbuild.py

# The same fail-closed chain, then the frozen DEVELOPMENT strategy/account replay.
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_alpaca_v2_postbuild.py --through-reference-replay

# Recommended authorized chain: DEVELOPMENT through May 11, then one-time
# walk-forward from May 12 through the exact validated V2 cutoff.
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_alpaca_v2_postbuild.py --through-walk-forward-replay --authorize-master-holdout-consumption
```

The post-build command is resumable at split-adjusted daily unit boundaries.
`--max-hours` can create a graceful checkpoint and the identical command continues
it. `--validate-only` performs no provider request. `--through-reference-replay`
opens DEVELOPMENT outcomes only and cannot read beyond `2026-05-11`.
`--through-walk-forward-replay` first completes that same DEVELOPMENT run, then
requires `--authorize-master-holdout-consumption`. Before any protected performance
read it writes an immutable self-hash-bound authorization tied to the exact source
and frozen policy fingerprints. After DEVELOPMENT succeeds and before protected
materialization starts, it writes the permanent consumption receipt; a materialization
or replay failure therefore remains consumed and cannot reset the holdout. Before
each receipt update, its previous state is preserved under
`manifests/master_holdout_consumption_history/`; the current self-hash and every
prior snapshot are verified on reads and retries. Known protected-row counts cannot
be cleared or changed. A verified completed run is reused without repeating either
replay; a missing or damaged completed result stops for repair. It then
creates a separate analytical manifest, starts signals on `2026-05-12`, and advances
chronologically through the exact source cutoff. Earlier rows in that input are
warm-up only. Neither replay may promote a strategy or submit a PAPER/LIVE order.
The DEVELOPMENT files remain physically capped at May 11; the authorized walk-forward
files and results remain separately labeled.
Provider rejections and malformed split-source rows remain evidence: when their
literal symbol is attributable, that symbol is excluded globally and the clean
remainder may proceed; an unattributed anomaly or unit-level validation failure
blocks materialization rather than poisoning or discarding the full database.
If source preparation passes but replay fails, the valid V2 daily foundation remains
recorded while the replay failure is explicit. Do not start this command in the same
working tree while the native acquisition process is still running.

Daily indicators are calculated by the frozen reference engine from the promoted V2
research view when a replay runs; a second giant feature lake is not created merely
to duplicate them. News acquisition is not part of this database acceptance chain:
it neither validates price history nor has a frozen provider/PIT contract, so it is
deferred to its own finite research package. Native minute evidence, extended-hours semantics, and initial intraday strategy readiness are accepted by B34. **B35 DEVELOPMENT replay CLOSED / ACCEPTED (2026-09-11).** The frozen `2016-01-04..2026-04-30` replay completed all **482/482 groups** and **59,768/59,768 source units**, with **482 validated receipt ids**, **20,171,286 fired opportunity/context/outcome records**, and run fingerprint `8955a282453cb89a24d3bcdf819d80451bebfa3ec9752dc24c113efc668cffe6`. The authoritative summary confirms consumed-master rows read `0`, future-blind rows read `0`, provider calls `0`, broker reads/writes `0/0`, PAPER/LIVE authority `false/false`, and strategy/selector promotion `false/false`. This closes the canonical B35 replay itself; the next Track-B work is the preregistered strategy x condition evidence and selector analysis, not another replay.

## Planned practitioner strategy library and confluence architecture

ATLAS already contains more practitioner work than the current four-strategy B35
pack. The accepted A33/B33 reference library has **six daily practitioner families
with nine direction-specific policies**, and B34/B35 adds **four intraday/opening
families**. Those ten existing families are retained; the successor package adds
**eleven genuinely new mechanisms** for a planned **21-family practitioner library**.
Do not duplicate an existing mechanism under a new name merely because a later chat
rediscovers it.

The completed B35 DEVELOPMENT experiment remains frozen around its four B34
strategies and is now immutable historical evidence. It must not be rewritten or
replayed to rescue a disappointing result. The broader library is successor work
under a new preregistered fingerprint.

### Existing practitioner families to retain

1. **50/200 moving-average trend cross / Golden Cross** —
   `ma_trend_cross_50_200_long_v1`. The accepted policy uses the standard 50-session
   SMA crossing above the 200-session SMA, 201 sessions minimum history, ATR-based
   risk, and reverse-cross/maximum-hold exit logic. This is already ATLAS's Golden
   Cross implementation; do not create a duplicate `golden_cross` strategy.
2. **20/50 EMA pullback continuation** — `ema_pullback_20_50_long_v1`. Established
   EMA uptrend, bounded pullback into the 20/50 trend zone, objective recovery,
   ATR/pullback-low risk geometry and finite holding horizon.
3. **12/26/9 MACD momentum shift** — `macd_shift_12_26_9_long_v1` and
   `macd_shift_12_26_9_short_v1`. Long requires an upside signal cross below zero;
   short mirrors it above zero. The short profile remains research-only for account
   admission until borrow/locate/recall economics exist.
4. **RSI trend-filtered recovery / mean reversion** —
   `rsi_recovery_14_trend_long_v1`. RSI(14) recovery through the frozen level inside
   the accepted long-trend filter; strong-trend behavior is measured rather than
   assumed to mean-revert.
5. **20-session Donchian high-volume breakout** —
   `donchian_breakout_20_volume_long_v1` and
   `donchian_breakout_20_volume_short_v1`. Prior rolling-channel escape, aligned
   trend and relative-volume evidence, with the decision bar excluded from the prior
   boundary. Short remains research-only for account admission.
6. **20-session Bollinger squeeze breakout** —
   `bollinger_squeeze_breakout_20_long_v1` and
   `bollinger_squeeze_breakout_20_short_v1`. Prior-session compression followed by a
   directional band escape, relative-volume evidence, ATR risk and finite hold.
7. **Gap continuation** — `b34_gap_continuation_v1`. Material overnight gap followed
   by the frozen continuation trigger; prior regular close anchors the B34/B35 risk
   rule.
8. **15-minute opening-range breakout** —
   `b34_opening_range_breakout_15m_v1`. Uses the completed 09:30-09:44 ET opening
   range and only acts after the range is information-safe; the opposite boundary
   anchors risk.
9. **Premarket relative-volume consolidation breakout** —
   `b34_premarket_relvol_consolidation_v1`. Requires unusual premarket participation,
   an objective premarket consolidation and the frozen post-open breakout.
10. **Highest-volume-day style** — `b34_highest_volume_day_style_v1`. Tests the
    practitioner thesis that exceptional current premarket participation versus
    prior high-volume sessions, combined with the frozen price-structure trigger,
    can identify continuation.

### Eleven new successor families

The next package adds only mechanisms that materially broaden the library. Exact
lookbacks, tolerances, bar authority, stops, targets and exits are frozen before any
new performance is opened.

11. **Bollinger-band mean reversion — `pract_bollinger_mean_reversion_v1`.** Detect a
    price excursion to/outside a frozen Bollinger envelope and require objective
    rejection/re-entry toward the band structure. A band touch alone is not a trade.
    Band width, trend regime, volume and volatility remain explicit conditional
    evidence so ATLAS can learn where mean reversion does or does not work.
12. **ATR volatility-expansion / consolidation breakout —
    `pract_atr_volatility_expansion_v1`.** Identify a normalized low-ATR/range
    contraction, then require directional price/range expansion beyond a frozen
    boundary. ATR measures volatility and supplies adaptive risk geometry; it does
    not choose direction by itself.
13. **VWAP reclaim / reject — `pract_vwap_reclaim_reject_v1`.** Intraday session-VWAP
    setup. Long research signal requires trading below VWAP followed by a
    deterministic reclaim-and-hold; the mirrored reject is the short research
    profile. Closed bars and an explicit confirmation rule are required; a single
    touch/cross is insufficient.
14. **Pivot support/resistance breakout — `pract_pivot_sr_breakout_v1`.** Build
    information-safe structural support/resistance from prior deterministic pivots
    or accepted ranges, then fire only on a confirmed boundary break. Relative
    volume, OBV and breakout distance are recorded as corroborating evidence rather
    than made hidden mandatory filters. This differs from Donchian by using
    structural pivot levels instead of a simple rolling extreme.
15. **Head-and-Shoulders / inverse Head-and-Shoulders —
    `pract_head_shoulders_v1`.** A shared deterministic pivot engine must identify
    the five alternating pivots that form left shoulder, head, right shoulder and
    the two neckline points. Freeze shoulder-similarity, head-prominence, spacing,
    neckline-slope and prior-trend rules. The setup is incomplete until an
    information-safe neckline break. Classic H&S is research-only short; inverse H&S
    is the long counterpart. Volume and formation duration are confirmation features.
16. **Double top / double bottom — `pract_double_top_bottom_v1`.** Require two
    separated tests of approximately the same resistance/support region, a material
    intervening reversal, and a break of the intervening neckline/support/resistance
    before firing. Double bottom is the long counterpart; double top is research-only
    short until short admission is available.
17. **Flag / pennant continuation — `pract_flag_pennant_v1`.** Require an objective
    impulse leg followed by a bounded, short consolidation with frozen retracement
    and contraction geometry, then a breakout in the original direction. Impulse
    strength, consolidation tightness, volume and breakout quality are retained as
    separate evidence.
18. **Triangle breakout — `pract_triangle_breakout_v1`.** Fit deterministic converging
    support/resistance boundaries from repeated prior pivots, classify ascending,
    descending or symmetrical geometry, and fire only on an information-safe
    boundary breakout. Breakout direction controls the signal; the visual pattern
    name alone never does.
19. **ADX/DMI continuation/filter — `pract_adx_dmi_continuation_v1`.** Use DMI for objective directional state and ADX for trend-strength state under one frozen rule. ADX alone never chooses direction. Test whether established directional strength improves continuation expectancy rather than assuming all high-ADX conditions are favorable.
20. **Relative-strength momentum — `pract_relative_strength_momentum_v1`.** Measure PIT ticker out/underperformance versus SPY over a small frozen horizon set and test continuation as its own family. The same relative-strength features may also be shared context for other strategies; sector-relative strength waits for an accepted PIT sector map.
21. **Session-level failed-break/reclaim — `pract_session_failed_break_reclaim_v1`.** Test breach and bounded reclaim of objective previous-day high/low and premarket high/low levels with normalized breach depth, explicit reclaim confirmation, sweep-extreme invalidation and one coherent exit hierarchy. This is observable failed-break/reversal research, not a claim about hidden institutional liquidity.

Cup-and-handle, candlestick-only patterns, stochastic-only systems and other popular
setups remain backlog candidates. Add them later only if they introduce a genuinely
new mechanism or evidence source rather than another correlated restatement of an
existing family.

### Confluence / evidence-strength layer

ATLAS will **not** turn simultaneous strategy alerts into a naive confidence vote.
Every strategy fires independently and keeps its own lineage, outcome history and
standalone statistics. A separate confluence layer asks whether *independent*
corroborating evidence improves conditional probability, net expectancy, downside or
capital efficiency.

Evidence is grouped into at least seven families: **trend**, **momentum**,
**volume/participation**, **price structure**, **volatility**, **chart pattern**, and
**context** (market/sector regime, liquidity, price band, time of day and other
point-in-time state). Raw same-direction strategy count is recorded, but correlated
signals inside one family are capped/regularized so several moving-average-derived
signals cannot masquerade as several independent confirmations. Distinct-family
agreement is measured separately. Opposing/conflicting evidence is preserved as a
negative feature; it is never silently removed.

This is why ATLAS should not initially create a new hard-coded "EMA + MACD" strategy:
the existing EMA-pullback and MACD families remain independently testable, and the
confluence layer can directly measure whether their same-direction agreement adds
value beyond either signal alone.

Research compares three systems: **A) standalone strategies**, **B) explicit
confirmation-filter variants**, and **C) confluence-ranked candidates**. First report
conditional outcome tables without invented manual point weights. If sample size and
stability justify it, a later interpretable conventional probability/expectancy model
may learn weights from training-only walk-forward data. Any displayed 0-100 strength
or confidence must map to a documented calibrated probability, percentile or frozen
score; it cannot be an arbitrary sum of indicators.

Confluence inputs may include primary strategy, distinct evidence-family agreement,
opposing signals, regime, trend, momentum, volume, volatility, structure, liquidity,
estimated cost, signal age and time-of-day. Same-session/future outcomes are forbidden
inputs. Confluence itself is a hypothesis and must beat standalone baselines out of
sample before it can affect qualification or capital priority.

### Controlled calibration and refinement

A losing v1 is evidence, not an instruction either to discard the mechanism
immediately or to tune it until green. After each frozen v1 evaluation, perform one
structured diagnostic review covering regime, liquidity, price band, time, volatility,
setup intensity, entry delay, MFE/MAE, stop/target path, cost drag, unresolved/no-entry
rate, loss concentration, losing streaks and confluence/conflict state.

Per strategy family and research cycle, create **no more than three materially
distinct v2 candidates by default**. Each requires a ledgered failure/opportunity
rationale, practitioner/statistical basis, exact rule change, declared trial count and
untouched evaluation source before performance is opened. Dense threshold sweeps,
tiny parameter stepping and repeated same-sample optimization are prohibited.
Original v1 results remain permanently ledgered. Data used to propose v2 is
training/diagnostic evidence only; v2 promotion requires a fresh walk-forward or other
untouched evaluation under a new fingerprint. Consumed master evidence is never
recycled, and an existing blind window is never reassigned after results are known.

### Implementation order and efficiency

B35 finishes first under its existing four-strategy fingerprint. After B35 closeout,
run the frozen B35 strategy x condition evidence and preregistered selector exactly as
planned. Then freeze the **eleven-new-family successor contract** plus the confluence
feature schema before opening their outcomes. Reuse the six accepted daily families
and four B34 intraday families rather than reimplementing them. Shared point-in-time
feature extraction, canonical bars, indicator primitives, deterministic pivots and
the validated parallel execution pattern should be reused where exact-equivalent,
while every strategy evaluator remains independently testable and deterministic.

The destination is not one universal strategy. It is a library of versioned
mechanisms whose standalone evidence, condition profile, confluence value, costs and
correlation are known well enough for ATLAS to rank good opportunities, abstain when
evidence is weak, and explain why one candidate outranks another.

## How progress is reported

### Reusable validated performance-optimization protocol

The B35 replay established the default ATLAS pattern for expensive deterministic or research workloads. Apply the same pattern, adapted to the workload's own correctness contract, to historical replays, data builds, validation passes, simulations, feature generation, large audits, and other batch work where runtime becomes material:

1. **Instrument before optimizing.** Establish a real baseline on the target workstation: completed work unit, elapsed time, throughput, ETA, worker/thread shape, and restart state. Do not optimize from intuition alone.
2. **Make the job restartable first.** Preserve atomic checkpoints, self-hash receipts, immutable input fingerprints, and validated completed work so experiments or interruptions never require discarding good canonical progress.
3. **Separate science/correctness from execution.** Frozen strategy rules, source scope, validators, outcome mechanics, authority, and final scientific fingerprints must not change merely to improve speed. Runtime metadata and completion order are non-authoritative.
4. **Profile the actual bottleneck.** Test concurrency, I/O shape, Python/object overhead, reusable process-local resources, and data-layout costs independently. More threads or fewer scans are not assumed faster; B35 demonstrated both diminishing concurrency returns and a major single-scan regression.
5. **Use isolated golden-output probes.** Recompute already completed canonical work in a temporary location and require the strongest available equivalence evidence—preferably byte-identical output hashes plus receipt/scientific-field parity—before an optimization may touch the canonical continuation path.
6. **Change one execution layer at a time.** Keep experiments narrow enough that gains or regressions have an attributable cause and can be cleanly reverted.
7. **Tune the real hardware empirically.** Benchmark worker x library-thread combinations on the actual host while reserving enough CPU/RAM/I/O headroom for the OS, remote administration, and coordinator. Keep the fastest scientifically equivalent measured shape, not the configuration that merely looks most parallel.
8. **Reuse infrastructure, not evidence shortcuts.** Safe examples include process-local database connections, immutable calendars, compiled/read-only helpers, and bounded non-scientific caches. Do not bypass source hashes, validators, checkpoint verification, protected-data boundaries, or required model/schema validation solely for speed.
9. **Reject regressions explicitly.** Preserve benchmark evidence for failed ideas so future work does not repeat them. Exact equivalence is necessary but not sufficient: a slower equivalent implementation is rejected unless it solves another material operational problem.
10. **Stop optimizing when execution is tractable.** Among accepted candidates, use the fastest measured scientifically equivalent implementation. Continue searching only when the projected time saved reasonably exceeds the engineering and revalidation cost or a clearly larger safe gain is available.
11. **Resume; do not restart.** Once the execution path is accepted, continue the canonical job from all validated receipts/checkpoints. Benchmark recomputes remain isolated and never advance or erase canonical progress.
12. **Close the loop with real-run evidence.** After the canonical workload completes, record final elapsed time, sustained throughput, interruptions/restarts, resource shape, and any difference from benchmark projections. Use that case history to size and design future long-running ATLAS work.

For B35 specifically, the measured path moved from about **660.6 units/hour** in the serial restart to a final isolated exact-equivalent benchmark of **2,942.2 units/hour** at 10 x 1, while preserving **10/10 byte-identical sampled outputs** and all scientific/authority boundaries. The accepted canonical continuation then reused 82 validated groups and computed the remaining **400 groups / 49,600 units in 11:40:46 at 4,246.7 units/hour**. That sustained real-run rate was about **6.43x the original serial rate** and **44.3% faster than the accepted isolated benchmark**, saving about **63.4 hours** versus serial processing for the remaining 49,600 units. At that sustained rate the equivalent full 59,768-unit workload is about **14.1 hours** instead of roughly **90.5 hours** serial. This completed case is the reference example for the reusable ATLAS efficiency protocol.

**Mandatory long-running runtime observability.** Any ATLAS command expected to run materially longer than an interactive task must expose operator-visible progress without changing scientific authority. At minimum it reports a start timestamp and PID, frozen scope and execution profile, completed/total groups or units and percentage, elapsed time, restart-reused work, throughput, a timestamped heartbeat at least once every 60 seconds even while one work item is long, and an ETA once enough new work exists (otherwise explicitly unavailable). Completion, failure, and interruption report their timestamp and elapsed duration. Terminal output is flushed promptly, and an atomic machine-readable status artifact is maintained for second-terminal and future GUI inspection. Runtime progress/status is **NON_AUTHORITATIVE**: wall-clock fields, worker order, heartbeats, throughput, ETA, and the status artifact never enter scientific identities, source/group fingerprints, receipt hashes, trial identity, strategy decisions, or final result fingerprints. Validated receipts and final scientific summaries remain the completion authority.

Every accepted package reports both scientific control and functioning product
progress. Examples include:

- strategy specified and implemented;
- historical replay completed;
- candidate generated and routed;
- trade and portfolio constructed;
- operational PAPER order planned or submitted under explicit authority;
- position managed and outcome recorded;
- strategy statistics and calibration updated;
- replay/dashboard/GUI control functioning;
- PIT audit, cost policy, protected reads, trial count, fingerprints, and authority
  state preserved.

Implementation uses the largest safe coherent package. Each package begins and
ends with a short plain-English account of its goal, capability change, result,
remaining risk, authority change, and next work. Root causes are repaired at the
owning layer; validators and scientific rules are never weakened to manufacture a
pass.

Documentation is part of acceptance, not cleanup. Every repository-changing
package must update this README and `docs/roadmap.md` together before merge with the
exact current capability, test/CI state when known, safety/authority effect,
unresolved limitations, and next action. Strategy-evidence-changing packages must
also update `docs/strategy_evidence_register.md`. If implementation or strategy
evidence changes but the applicable living documents do not, the package is
incomplete and must not be treated as the new handoff.

These results may inform future work but may not be retuned into positive findings.
The retained master holdout was subsequently consumed exactly once by the frozen
A33/B33 V2 walk-forward on 2026-09-07; that consumption does not rewrite the
separate earlier branch statements below, which correctly record zero protected
return reads for those experiments. LIVE and automatic broker failover remain
disabled.

### Retained exact historical validator statements

The following literals are retained as **historical evidence**, not as the current
product dependency. They allow accepted phase validators to continue recognizing
the facts they were written to certify:

- Phases26–31 are scientifically valid `ACCEPTED_NEGATIVE`; Phase32 is `ACCEPTED_NEGATIVE` as well.
- Phase32 policy fingerprint: `4e9d22e9ec3bae8058484a6a0e78e786c2c2822bc5a8607b294a21fb17a0bff7`.
- Phase32 frozen source evidence: 46 event rows / 33 signal sessions / 40 unique instruments.
- Phase33 signal-to-trade remains blocked was the superseded roadmap rule; its LIVE-authority conclusion remains binding, while baseline Product construction is now allowed.
- XBRL protected return rows read = **0**; closeout fingerprint `291770f7ee110dc85453f58e6410bee4a4431ac44c17f3e59b272fb88315ac91`.
- LIVE and automatic broker failover remain disabled.

## Successor Strategy Lab direction — 21 families

After the accepted B35 targeted perturbation diagnostic closes, Track B proceeds to a new preregistered successor research package rather than modifying B35 v1. The next broad historical experiment targets **21 economic strategy families** plus a bounded set of explicitly versioned challengers. The ten retained families remain immutable baselines; eleven distinct additions are planned: Bollinger mean reversion, ATR/range expansion, VWAP reclaim/reject, pivot support/resistance breakout, ADX/DMI continuation/filter, relative-strength momentum versus market/sector, deterministic head-and-shoulders/inverse, double-top/bottom, flag/pennant continuation, triangle breakout, and objective session-level failed-break/reclaim. Nearby parameterizations remain members of one economic family for multiplicity and confluence.

The Opening Range family receives two high-priority successor policies, not two new independent families: a **Stocks-in-Play 5-minute ORB/opening-momentum** policy using abnormal same-time opening participation and executable liquidity/volatility controls, and a **15-minute ORB close + bounded retest confirmation** challenger designed to test false-break reduction. The failed-break/reclaim family uses only observable PIT levels (initially previous-day high/low and premarket high/low) and makes no hidden-liquidity or ICT/SMC claim.

The successor experiment also adds a shared PIT context layer before confluence/ranking: broad-market alignment, ticker relative strength/weakness versus SPY, bounded higher-timeframe trend, trend maturity/extension, participation/relative volume, overnight gap, signal time, price band, realized volatility, and liquidity/execution quality. Sector-relative strength waits for an accepted PIT sector map. Context is measured first for incremental value and is not automatically a hard filter. Confluence remains separate from standalone strategy firing and counts independent evidence families rather than correlated indicators. Portfolio loss limits, simultaneous-position competition, concentration, and capital allocation remain account/PAPER-layer questions; fixed arbitrary stops/targets, human psychology rules, small discretionary watchlists, and reopened failed SEC hypotheses are not part of this successor strategy package.

The large successor run must report standalone v1 baselines, each frozen challenger, condition coverage, win rate, payoff ratio, net expectancy/net-R, cost decay, MFE/MAE, drawdown, concentration, fold stability, and abstention. The objective is broader **economically viable condition coverage**, not maximizing win rate or forcing every strategy to trade broadly. Candidate context interactions are frozen before performance, tested incrementally with multiplicity control, and any favorable condition-gated successor requires new untouched/prospective evidence before authority promotion.
